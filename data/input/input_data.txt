Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data  It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so  Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks
A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition Topics include:  Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)  Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI) The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect
The robot-depicted world of our not-so-distant future relies heavily on our ability to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) successfully However, transforming machines into thinking devices is not as easy as it may seem Strong AI can only be achieved with machine learning (ML) to help machines understand as humans do
Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence However, deep learning is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and neural networks is a sub-field of deep learning
The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required and enabling the use of larger data sets You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture  Classical, or "non-deep", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn"Deep" machine learning can leverage labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset It can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (eg text, images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another Unlike machine learning, it doesn't require human intervention to process data, allowing us to scale machine learning in more interesting ways Deep learning and neural networks are primarily credited with accelerating progress in areas, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition
Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network The “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the depth of layers in a neural network A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the inputs and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network A neural network that only has two or three layers is just a basic neural network
